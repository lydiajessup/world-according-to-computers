',\n",
       " '  He added, how I had endeavoured to persuade him, that in my own and other countries, the _Yahoos_ acted as the governing, rational animal, and held the _Houyhnhnms_ in servitude; that he observed in me all the qualities of a _Yahoo_, only a little more civilized by some tincture of reason, which, however, was in a degree as far inferior to the _Houyhnhnm_ race, as the _Yahoos_ of their country were to me; that, among other things, I mentioned a custom we had of castrating _Houyhnhnms_ when they were young, in order to render them tame; that the operation was easy and safe; that it was no shame to learn wisdom from brutes, as industry is taught by the ant, and building by the swallow (for so I translate the word _lyhannh_, although it be a much larger fowl); that this invention might be practised upon the younger _Yahoos_ here, which besides rendering them tractable and fitter for use, would in an age put an end to the whole species, without destroying life; that in the mean time the _Houyhnhnms_ should be exhorted to cultivate the breed of asses, which, as they are in all respects more valuable brutes, so they have this advantage, to be fit for service at five years old, which the others are not till twelve. ',\n",
       " '  When my clothes were worn to rags, I made myself others with the skins of rabbits, and of a certain beautiful animal, about the same size, called _nnuhnoh_, the skin of which is covered with a fine down. ',\n",
       " ' After a short silence, he told me, “he did not know how I would take what he was going to say: that in the last general assembly, when the affair of the _Yahoos_ was entered upon, the representatives had taken offence at his keeping a _Yahoo_ (meaning myself) in his family, more like a _Houyhnhnm_ than a brute animal; that he was known frequently to converse with me, as if he could receive some advantage or pleasure in my company; that such a practice was not agreeable to reason or nature, or a thing ever heard of before among them; the assembly did therefore exhort him either to employ me like the rest of my species, or command me to swim back to the place whence I came: that the first of these expedients was utterly rejected by all the _Houyhnhnms_ who had ever seen me at his house or their own; for they alleged, that because I had some rudiments of reason, added to the natural pravity of those animals, it was to be feared I might be able to seduce them into the woody and mountainous parts of the country, and bring them in troops by night to destroy the _Houyhnhnms’_ cattle, as being naturally of the ravenous kind, and averse from labour.

       " '  When Zidore took the animal to pasture, he had to pull on the rope with all his might, because it walked so slowly; and the youth, bent over and out of breath, would swear at it, exasperated at having to care for this old nag. ',\n",
       " '  When summer came he had to move the animal about in the pasture. ',\n",
       " ' The animal would try to escape, to kick, to get away from the blows, and run around in a circle about its rope, as though it had been inclosed in a circus ring. ',\n",

       " ' He came nearer, looked at the animal, threw at his head a clump of earth which flattened out against the white hair, and he started off again, whistling. ',\n",
       " ' The animal was so old that nobody was surprised. ',\n",
       " ' He was crying in a soft, tender voice: “Cocotte! Come here, Cocotte, my beauty!” and slapping his thigh as one does when calling an animal. ',\n",
       " \" The animal ran a little farther away, but came back again as soon as the man's back was turned. \",\n",

       " ' Then he bethought himself that he could find no other situation as long as he dragged this animal about with him. ',\n",
       " \" What a catch, old man! It isn't thin, either!” He kept swimming about at a distance from the animal that was in a state of decomposition. \",\n",
       " '  Going down quickly, he saw the animal sniffing at the crack of the door and barking furiously, as if some tramp had been sneaking about the house. ',\n",
       " ' Some roast monkey took away all desire to make a steady diet of this animal, and the great monkey who roamed about among us at large and playfully pushed his head into my glass when I wished to drink cured me of any desire I might have to take one of his brothers as a companion for the rest of my days.

       " ' If he acted as he did it was because he loved me, was it not?”  The old woman was silent and began to stroke the lifeless animal whose body trembled on its iron framework. ']"
